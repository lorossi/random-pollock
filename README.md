# Random Pollock

## One big question

One of the artist that I admire is Jackson Pollock. He has created more than 20 of the most famous abstract expressionist paintings. He is also the father of the *action painting*, a unique style of painting in which the paint is *splashed* (is this even a word?) on the canvas and let drip.

It is a really *curious* method, to say the least. Pollock himself was nicknamed "Jack the dripper" by the Times.

I would not like to own a Pollock, nor I would hang one of his paintings on a wall inside my home (not that I would be able to afford it, since they sell for millions of dollars) but I asked myself: *"Can I replicate his technique using code?"
